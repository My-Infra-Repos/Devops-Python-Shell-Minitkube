# Devops assignment
main.py is the main file containing our application built upon fast api & uvicorn server. We have also implemented swagger & redoc here. End point '/' will take you to home where a meanigful message is displayed. At end point '/tree' we will be getting favourite tree name whereas at endpoint '/docs' swagger documentation will be visible.

**##Testing**
We have tested our api with pytest python framework. We have also uplodaded the test log & test_main.py for the same.

**##manifest for minikube**
We have written the manifest to run minikubeversion 1.24 & generate a deployment, service & an ingress.

**##How to work**
simply clone this repository & run the incluided shell script.

**Note: Required minikuibe & version should be installed on the machine before running the same.**
